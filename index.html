      <p class="right">Pat was born on a blustery day in 1974 in Seattle, Washington. His mother was a school teacher and his father was a fisherman in Alaska. His father would sometimes take his on his boat trips and one fateful day Pat fell off the boat and was stranded at sea for two weeks. Thanks to his boy scout training, he was able to subsist purely on salmon for the entire time he was out at sea. When he was finally picked up by an Alaskan cruise ship, he seemed to have lost his mind, babbling about cookies and salmon. </br></br>
      A while later, when he had regained some sanity, he formulated a plan to share his love of salmon with the world through cookies. He came back to Seattle and began tinkering with a recipe for salmon cookies, and has been perfecting it ever since. The first Pat's Salmon Cookies shop opened in 1996, and the business has expanded to 4 other locations since then. Now Pat's Salmon Cookies are the highest-selling salmon cookies in the world.</p>
